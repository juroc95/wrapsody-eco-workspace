# Welcome to the Fasoo 2022 Global Internship Project - Wrapsody eCo Workspace

This repository is for reference purposes only and does not contain any code because it is related to a proprietary company product.

## Project Overview

As a member of the four-person development team, we contributed to the successful launch of Wrapsody eCo Workspace. We designed and implemented a user-friendly collaborative workspace within Wrapsody eCo, utilizing a real-time open-source collaborative text editor to encourage open communication and idea sharing. Our efforts were instrumental in improving team communication and collaboration within Wrapsody eCo by enabling users to easily share their opinions within the company platform, eliminating the need for multiple platforms.

On the final day of the internship, we demonstrated the capabilities and potential of Wrapsody eCo Workspace to the CEO, team leaders, and senior developers through an impactful presentation.
