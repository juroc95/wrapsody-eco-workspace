## Project Overview

During the Fasoo 2022 Global Internship, our team developed Wrapsody eCo Workspace, a real-time collaborative workspace designed to enhance communication and idea-sharing within Wrapsody eCo. Our goal was to integrate real-time document collaboration directly into the platform, eliminating the need for third-party tools.

To achieve this, we researched over 10 open-source text editors and selected Etherpad for its real-time editing capabilities, active development, flexible licensing, and extensive plugin ecosystem. We then successfully integrated Etherpad into Wrapsody eCo, enabling users to collaborate more efficiently within a single platform.

In addition to the integration, we worked on refining the user interface, ensuring that the UI components matched Wrapsody eCo’s design style. We also implemented user authority control, restricting access to certain features based on roles such as document manager, read-only, and read & write users.

On the final day of the internship, we presented our project to Fasoo’s CEO, board members, and senior developers, highlighting its impact on team collaboration and its potential for commercial expansion within Wrapsody eCo.
